<h1 style="color:#993366;text-align:center;">So you have a Makerspace, Now What</h1>
<p>How to make it work</p>
    <p> Why it should work, this could be pedogogy. The idea of many websites to state that the best way for students to learn STEM or STEAM, or to work in a Maker Space is for them to fail up or fail, or figure it out on their own. While many of us have learned things on our own, and perhaps those are things we are much more interested in; is it truley how you have learned most things</p>
    <p> Tools and equipment what you might want to get, or maybe not, not all lists are the same</p>
