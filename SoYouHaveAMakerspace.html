<h1 style="color:#993366;text-align:center;">So you have a Makerspace, Now What</h1>
<p>How I make it work</p>
   <p>I teach in the makerspace the way I learned to make things. The two primary and traditional ways I learned to make while in school were shop class and art class.</p>
	<p>In high school I was in a program to teach students welding as a trade; additonaly I have a Masters of Fine Art and a Bachelors of Fine Art.</p>
	<p>The "trade" school and the "art" school have a lot in common,both rely on a model of hands on education. In my experience, learning in either of these environments goes something close to this: </p>
	<p> The teacher shows something to the class, this could be a technique, a demonstration on a tool or other piece of equipment or what could generally be called a tool, or an example of a work or project</p>
	<p>This is usually followed by the instructor giving the students the access to the tools and materials to practice the new skill or tool, technique or concept.</p>
	<p> Eventually the teacher should begin to move away and let the studnets work through solutions on thier own to better give the skills needed to solve the problems realated to the skill or technique</p>
