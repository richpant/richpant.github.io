<h1 style="color:#993366;text-align:center;">So you have a Makerspace, Now What</h1>
<p>How I make it work</p>
   <p>I teach in the makerspace the way I learned to make things. The two primary and traditional ways I learned to make while in school were shop class and art class.</p>
	<p>In high school I was in a program to teach students welding as a trade; additonaly I have a Master of Fine Art and a Bachelor of Fine Art</p>
	<p>the "trade" school and the "art" school have a lot in common. Both rely on a model of hands on education. In my experience it has gone something close ot this, </p>
	<p> The teacher shows something to the class, this could be a technique, a demonstration on a tool or other piece of equipment or what could generally be called a tool</p>
	<p>This is usually followed by the instructor giving the students the access to the tools and materials to practice the new skill or tool</p>
	<p> Eventually the teacher should begin to move away and let the studnets work through solutions on thier own to better give the skills needed to solve the problems realated to the skill or technique</p>
